=head1 REST API

This document defines the REST API.  By and large, this follows the WebIOpi 
REST interface:

  https://code.google.com/p/webiopi/wiki/INSTALL?tm=6

There are a few notable differences, mostly to account for being on more 
than just the Rapsberry Pi.  For instance, the pcDuino has different 
voltage and bit resolutions for some of its ADC and PWM channels, so 
the API to access that data must specify a pin.

Specific differences are noted as "B<COMPATIBILITY NOTE>" below.

=head2 Status Codes

Just a few of the HTTP status codes you might expect to hit.

=head3 200 OK

Success

=head3 404 Not Found

Using a path that isn't one of the ones defined, or using the name of 
a device that's not configured. (Split into different status code?  403 
for a device not found, maybe?  Doesn't seem quite right.)

=head3 405 Method Not Allowed

You used a method that isn't allowed for this resource.

=head3 409 Conflict

May happen when trying to use a pin as output when it was set as output.

=head3 410 Gone

May happen when you request a pin that doesn't exist.

=head3 500 Internal Server Error

The server done broke.
